# Udacity Capstone Project

This repo contains my final project on Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree! \o/

I decided to use a dataset from Kaggle. this dataset was provided by Home Credit and the objective is predict if the applicant's will repayed or not their loan.

To work in this project I broke it into 5 steps.

I find some algorithm that can works and some needs to improve the results.
